        I joined Zetech university in 2020,although at the time we had online classes and as we went on with 
        classes we were told that the following year we will have physical classes so i was really excited 
        to experience  campus life physically.</p>
        <p>
        My experience in university has been one of the most rewarding and transformative experiences 
        of my life. From the moment I stepped foot on campus, I was immersed in a world of new ideas, 
        new perspectives, and new people. I quickly found myself surrounded by a diverse and passionate 
        student body, all with their own unique stories and experiences. As a result, my university 
        experience has been a journey of self-discovery and growth.</p>
        <p>As a freshman, I found myself exposed to a range of new concepts and ideas. I was challenged 
        to think critically and creatively, and to develop my own stance on the issues of the day. 
        Through my classes, I was able to explore my interests in a variety of disciplines and hone 
        my skills in writing and communication. Throughout my university experience, I have been able 
        to expand my knowledge and develop a more nuanced understanding of the world.</p>
        <p>
        Moreover, my university experience has helped me to gain an appreciation for the diversity of 
        perspectives and opinions that exist in the world. Through my interactions with peers and faculty, 
        I have been able to gain insight into the different ways of viewing the world. As a result, I have 
        been able to develop a more open-minded approach to situations and an ability to see things from 
        different angles. </p>
        <p>As excited as i was to join campus I still had to study. I pursued a course in Information Technology
            where at first i thought I could'nt pull it off.I pushed myself and I realized that the course was actually
            interesting and fun since it's about developing new and very creative things. I developed some few projects 
            and that helped in expounding my creative mind.</p>

           <p>However, there are some challenges I had to face due to some unavoidable circumstances. This course requires 
            internet use 24/7 and I had to buy data anytime i needed to access the internet to get assignments done and 
            completed in timme,basically this was my biggest challenge and i was able to overcome it by installing WIFI in my 
            house and this really made everything I did very easier.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to all the learning and fun, I graduated with a diploma in Information Technology which I got really 
            excited for,had alot of fun with friends and family. Now I plan on pursuing a degree course in the same field 
            of Technology and become a web developer which is what I really enjoy doing in my own free time.
